## common

# Listen on the given IP address(es). Both --interface and --listen-address
# options may be given, in which case the set of both interfaces and addresses
# is used. Note that if no --interface option is given, but --listen-address
# is, dnsmasq will not automatically listen on the loopback interface. To
# achieve this, its IP address, 127.0.0.1, must be explicitly given as a
# --listen-address option.
listen-address=127.0.0.1

# Listen only on the specified interface(s). Dnsmasq automatically adds the
# loopback (local) interface to the list of interfaces to use when the
# --interface option  is used.
interface=en0

# Do not listen on the specified interface.
#except-interface=lo

# Enable a network mode which is a hybrid between --bind-interfaces and the default.
# Dnsmasq binds the address of individual interfaces, allowing multiple dnsmasq
# instances, but if new interfaces or addresses appear, it automatically listens on
# those (subject to any access-control configuration).
bind-dynamic

## dns

# Listen on <port> instead of the standard DNS port (53). Setting this to zero
# completely disables DNS function, leaving only DHCP and/or TFTP.
port=53

# Don't read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream servers only from the command line
# or the dnsmasq configuration file.
#no-resolv

# Don't poll /etc/resolv.conf for changes.
#no-poll

# Don't read the hostnames in /etc/hosts.
no-hosts

# Additional hosts file. Read the specified file as well as /etc/hosts.
# If --no-hosts is given, read only the specified file.
addn-hosts=/etc/hosts.local

# Bogus private reverse lookups. All reverse lookups for private IP ranges
# (ie 192.168.x.x, etc) which are not found in /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases
# file are answered with "no such domain" rather than being forwarded upstream.
bogus-priv

# Tells dnsmasq to never forward A or AAAA queries for plain names, without dots
# or domain parts, to  upstream  nameservers.
domain-needed

# Reject (and log) addresses from upstream nameservers which are in the private
# ranges. This blocks an attack where a browser behind a firewall is used to
# probe machines on the local network.
stop-dns-rebind

# Exempt 127.0.0.0/8 and ::1 from rebinding checks. This address range is
# returned by realtime black hole servers, so blocking it may disable these
# services.
rebind-localhost-ok

# Remove AAAA records from answers. No IPv6 addresses will be returned.
filter-AAAA

# Later versions of windows make periodic DNS requests which don't get sensible
# answers from the public DNS and can cause problems by triggering
# dial-on-demand links.
#filterwin2k

# Add the domain to simple names (without a period) in /etc/hosts in the same
# way as for DHCP-derived names.
expand-hosts

# Default domain (needed by dhcp-fqdn)
domain=local

# Specifies DNS domains for the DHCP server.
domain=local,192.0.2.0/24,local

# Specify an IP address to return for any host in the given domains. Queries in
# the domains are never forwarded and always replied to with the specified IP
# address which may be IPv4 or IPv6. To give both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for a
# domain, use repeated --address flags.

## tftp

# Enable  the  TFTP  server  function.
#enable-tftp

# Look for files to transfer using TFTP relative to the given directory.
#tftp-root=/srv/tftp

# Set the maximum number of concurrent TFTP connections allowed.
#tftp-max=1000

## dhcp

# Do not provide DHCP or TFTP on the specified interface, but do provide
# DNS service.
no-dhcp-interface=en1

# Should be set when dnsmasq is definitely the only DHCP server on a network.
# For DHCPv4, it changes the behaviour from strict RFC compliance so that DHCP
# requests on unknown leases from unknown hosts are not ignored. This allows
# new hosts to get a lease without a tedious timeout under all circumstances.
# It also allows dnsmasq to rebuild its lease database without each client
# needing to reacquire a lease, if the database is lost. For DHCPv6 it sets the
# priority in replies to 255 (the maximum) instead of 0 (the minimum).
dhcp-authoritative

# Limits dnsmasq to the specified maximum number of DHCP leases. The default
# is 1000. This limit is to prevent DoS attacks from hosts which create
# thousands of leases and use lots of memory in the dnsmasq process.
dhcp-lease-max=128

# Address ranges (pools) configuration
dhcp-range=192.0.2.1,static,255.255.255.0,1h

# Read DHCP host information from the specified file. The file contains
# information about one host per line. The format of a line is the same as text
# to the right of '=' in --dhcp-host.
dhcp-hostsfile=/etc/ethers.local

# (IPv4  only) Generate a name for DHCP clients which do not otherwise
# have one, using the MAC address expressed in hex, separated by dashes.
# Note that if a host provides a name, it will be used by preference to
# this, unless --dhcp-ignore-names is set.
dhcp-generate-names

# In the default mode, dnsmasq inserts the unqualified names of DHCP clients
# into the DNS. For this reason, the names must be unique, even if two clients
# which have the same name are in different domains. If a second DHCP client
# appears which has the same name as an existing client, the name is
# transferred to the new client. If --dhcp-fqdn is set, this behaviour changes:
# the unqualified name is no longer put in the DNS, only the qualified name.
# Two DHCP clients with the same name may both keep the name, provided that the
# domain part is different (ie the fully qualified names differ.) To ensure that
# all names have a domain part, there must be at least --domain without an
# address specified when --dhcp-fqdn is set.
