This project contains full container build infrastructure using
docker(1) as container management system.

To deploy containers on fresh system (e.g. fresh installation of
Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS with docker.io package installed) you
need to provide few configuration files:

  for all containers:
    /var/local/docker/_/profile
	__host='dh'
	__domain='example.com'
	__fqdn="${__host}.${__domain}"

  for nginx container:
    /var/local/docker/nginx/profile
	nginx_cbtsh_http_url='https://acme-le.gw.api.example.com/~letsencrypt'
	nginx_cbtsh_http_auth='<http_basic_auth_password>'
	nginx_cbtsh_ph='<cert_pkey_passphrase>'

Provided above settings are bare minimum necessary to successfuly build
and start containers using update.sh.

You may wish to tune more settings by providing more shell variable
assignments in /profile files (yes, these files sourced and evaluated
in shell interpreter environment).

Each container can be (re)build individually by running <ct_name>/ci/run.sh
directly. See "<ct_name>/ci/run.sh --help" output for more details on
options and parameters accepted. You may change /profile parameters by
providing corresponding option value to run.sh.

To update all containers (e.g. due to basic image security updates or new
version of containerized software) simply run

	./update.sh

or run "<ct_name>/ci/run.sh" for individual container.
